		<h3>Short Biography</h3>
			<p>Hi, my name is Adrian Sharpe. I am a junior at Tufts University double majoring in Computer Science and French. 
				I'm from London, Canada. My hobbies include playing Basketball, listening to music and reading self-help books.
				I'm interested in Education and introducing coding to youth. I hope to someday merge my computer science degree with my
				interest in kids whether that's in the classroom or elsewhere.</p>
